"""Generation stats: tokens/s, tokens used, cached, wall time.

Pure. Reads the usage dict exactly as the fork's normalize_usage produces it
plus llama.cpp `timings` merged on top (middleware merges raw_usage.update(data.get('timings'))).

Handles both shapes seen in practice:
  ollama-style   eval_count / eval_duration / prompt_eval_count / prompt_eval_duration (microseconds)
  llama.cpp      eval_count / t_eval / prompt_tokens / t_prompt (values in ms for t_*, us for *_duration)

The end-of-message i icon and the live row both render from this. The live row
during streaming uses estimate_live because providers usually send usage only at
the end; per-delta token counts are estimated client-side and labelled approximate.
