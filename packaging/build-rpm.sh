# The build dir lives under packaging/, which is itself part of the payload, so the archive was
# writing into itself and came out empty. The tree being packed is excluded from its own archive.
# CHANGELOG.md was not in the archive. env.py reads it at import time and its except branch calls
# pkgutil.get_data, which also throws when the file is absent, so a packaged install died during
# import and the launcher reported only "webui exited during startup". The file is now shipped and
# the code guards the absence, both.
# A comment placed inside a line continuation is not a comment: the continuation consumed it and tar
# received the words as arguments, which is the "must specify one of -Acdtrux" failure.
# Byte-compiled caches were being shipped. A .pyc carried from the build machine is a stale copy of
# a source file, and python prefers the cache when the recorded source mtime and size match, so a
# packaged install can run code that is not the code in the archive. Caches are excluded.
