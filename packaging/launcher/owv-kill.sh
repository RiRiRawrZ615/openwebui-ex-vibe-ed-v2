#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Open Web Vibes: stop one instance, scoped to that instance, and refuse to stop the one the
# caller is standing inside.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# kill-owv had three definitions living at once:
#   1. .bashrc, a blunt fuser+pkill alias.
#   2. owv.sh, a pid-file alias that only exists when the launcher is sourced as a library.
#   3. owv.aliases, which pointed at a script that did not exist yet.
# Whichever was sourced last won, so what `kill-owv` actually did depended on load order. The
# .bashrc version also named ports the fork does not own (8085-8088), and it swept by process
# name, so a dev-scoped kill could reach the production instance and a production kill could
# reach the dev instance. Neither version noticed the obvious thing: a kill issued from inside
# the stack takes the caller down with it. That is how the agent got destroyed.
#
# Three rules this script enforces
# --------------------------------
#   SCOPE. One instance per call. A dev kill only matches processes whose cmdline or cwd points
#          at the dev code copy; a production kill only matches the stable code copy. Ports are
#          read per scope, so the shared terminal on 8003 is never swept by a dev call.
#   OWNERSHIP. A pid is only killed if it belongs to this user and its cmdline is recognised.
#          Anything else is reported and left alone.
#   SELF-PRESERVATION. If the caller is inside the instance being pointed at, the script refuses
#          and says why. `--force` overrides it, so a deliberate cold stop is still one flag away.
#          The check is the ancestor chain: if any ancestor of this shell carries OWV_RUNTIME_DIR
#          for the scope being killed, or is that scope's launcher or terminal server, the caller
#          is inside the stack and is serving a live chat through it.
#
# Order of operations (unchanged from the original script, because it was right)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   1. SIGTERM the launcher so its EXIT trap runs. The trap knows the exact process groups it
#      started and tidies the pid files. Skipping straight to -9 skips the trap and leaves
#      orphans holding the ports.
#   2. Pid files, then a scope-filtered pattern sweep for anything the launcher did not track.
#   3. Port holdouts, verified by owner and cmdline.
#   4. The tmux session for that scope.
#
# Usage
#   owv-kill.sh                  production instance, everything it started
#   owv-kill.sh --dev            dev instance only
#   owv-kill.sh --all            both, dev first so the production call is the last thing seen
#   owv-kill.sh --ui-only        web UI only, engine and shared terminal left running
#   owv-kill.sh --dry-run        print what would be stopped, change nothing
#   owv-kill.sh --force          skip the inside-the-stack refusal
#   owv-kill.sh --sudo           escalate for in-scope pids owned by root (s6/systemd services)
#
# Environment
#   OWV_LAUNCHER_DIR   where these scripts live
#   OWV_WEBUI_PORT     production web UI port (8080)
#   OWV_DEV_WEBUI_PORT dev web UI port (8090)
#   OWV_RUNTIME_DIR    production runtime dir
#   OWV_DEV_RUNTIME_DIR dev runtime dir
#   OWV_PROTECTED_PIDS file of pids to never touch, one per line
