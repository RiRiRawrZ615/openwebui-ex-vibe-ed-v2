# Shell aliases for a packaged Open Web Vibes install: start, stop, watch, status.
#
# This file is the single source of the alias definitions. The launcher sources it when it is used
# as a library, and /etc/profile.d/openwebvibes.sh sources it for interactive login shells, so a
# fresh install has the same set without anyone editing their shell rc by hand.
#
# Deliberately left out: any alias that could reach a second instance. A packaged install is one
# instance, so there is no dev scope here, and a kill that sweeps by process name or by shared
# port is how a running instance gets taken down by accident. Everything that stops something
# goes through owv-kill.sh, which checks ownership, refuses targets outside its scope, and refuses
# to kill the instance the calling shell is standing inside. --force is the escape hatch, and it
# is the only way to get past that guard.

# interactive shell, so a packaged definition cannot be relied on to win. Measured on two machines
# where kill-owv still resolved to a stock launcher script. owv-kill is not a name anything else
# defines, so it is unambiguous.
