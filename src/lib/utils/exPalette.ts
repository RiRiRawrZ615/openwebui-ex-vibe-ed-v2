/**
 * OpenWebVibes palette, in hex.
 *
 * Why hex and not the oklch values in src/ex_theme.css: the two places that stamp the
 * ramp onto <html> do it with `element.style.setProperty`, which takes a string the browser
 * must be able to parse on its own. Hex is unambiguous there, and it keeps the inline values
 * and the stylesheet fallbacks describing the same colors instead of drifting.
 *
 * These are the same lightness steps as src/tailwind.css (0.32 / 0.27 / 0.20 / 0.16), so
 * every stock `text-gray-*` pairing keeps the contrast it was designed with. Only the hue
 * changes.
 *
 * KEEP IN SYNC with the literal copy in src/app.html. That script runs before any module
 * loads, so it cannot import this file. If these values change, change both, or the first
 * paint will disagree with everything after it.
