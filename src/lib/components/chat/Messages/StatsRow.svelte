<!-- Per-message generation stats.

Sits below the message, not above it. The old placement put the row before the answer, which
pushed the text down by a line and, worse, read as a header for the reply rather than a
footnote about it. llama-ui puts its counters under the message, and that is the right place:
the answer is the content, the numbers describe how it arrived.

Per-message, not per-turn. The previous version divided the whole message by elapsed wall time,
so a long agentic turn reported one blended number that described the turn instead of the reply.
Rates here come from a trailing arrival window (see ArrivalRate in exStats.ts), which is what
makes the figure mean "right now".

During streaming the numbers are estimates from a character heuristic and are marked with a
leading tilde. Once the provider sends its usage block they are replaced with real figures.
